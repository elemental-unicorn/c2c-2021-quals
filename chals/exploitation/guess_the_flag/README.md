# Guess the flag

## Description
I hope you like guessing games. This one is simple - guess the flag, and it'll tell you if you're right.

Despite how this looks on the surface do not attempt to brute force the flag.
```bash
nc guess-the-flag.ctf.fifthdoma.in 4242
```

## Solve

Running the following as the guess tricks the shell script into a 'true' state and therefore printing the flag. This is refered to as shell injection and happens when user input is not properly sanitised.

```bash
python3 solve.py
```

## Flag
```
FLAG{why_is_[_a_regular_command}
```
